## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### Screenshot

I'll include screenshots in my GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the third project I've worked on with email validation, so I feel like I've got that down pretty well. However, this is the first project I've done with validation for other form elements. That was fairly simple. I'm sure eventually I'll want to make some more password requirements, but I feel like this was a good start.

I did have trouble with the error icons, and I eventually just didn't include them. When I set them to position:absolute, they just disappeared and I couldn't find them.

### Continued development

I'm almost done with Newbie level projects! I'm going to start working on Junior projects soon, so hopefully I will be able to do more complex JavaScript.

### Useful resources
